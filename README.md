4. Submit the new issue.

<h3>Features left to implement</h3>

- A forum page where users can interact and create topics to discuss<br>
<br>
<h2>Fixed Bugs</h2>
- Portal 800 not rendaring because of a typo in the for loop: for post in posts - error: from posts in posts<br>
- ModuleNotFound error: from .form import CommetForm, corrected: from .forms import CommentForm <br>
<br>
<img src="static/assets/images/error1.jpg" alt="creating a table of content for comments">
<br>
- Error rendering template: missing a ‘,’ in @admin.register(Post)<br>
<br>summernote_fields = ('content',)
<br>
- Error in rendering the template: added an exclamation mark by mistake in an if statement<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
- Error Page Not Found 404 when adding the LoginRequiredMixin to classes PostCreate, PostUpdateView and PostDeleteView, as login_url was not found initially, as I have added the html page for login. After checking the error page, I found the login_url is looking into URL patterns, so I've added '/accounts/login/' as the login_url and the page worked, redirecting unlogged users to the login page.

<br>
<h2>Data Model</h2>
<br>
The code has models, templates and views, working on the Django framework.<br>
There is a base.html to include the navigation bar and the footer, which is then extended in each other html files.<br>
Including a superuser to control the admin panel, the front end has an interactive interface for users to join the fun.<br>
An automatic message was installed to give feedback to the user when interacting with the site.<br>
A JavaScript function is added at the end of the base.html file to make the automatic messaged dissapear after a few seconds.<br>
The workspace was deployed to Heroku at the beginning, leaving for a final deployment when finished<br>
